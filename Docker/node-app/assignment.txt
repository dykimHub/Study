1) Create appropriate images
docker build .

2) Launch a container for each created image, making sure, 
that the app inside the container works correctly and is usable.
docker run -p 8000:3000 {imageID}

3) Re-create both containers and assign names to both containers.
Use these names to stop and restart both containers.
docker run -p 8000:3000 --name nodeApp {imageID}
docker stop nodeApp
docker start nodeApp

4) Clean up (remove) all stopped (and running) containers, 
clean up all created images.
docker rm nodeApp
docker rmi {imageID}
docker image prune -a # 이미지 전체 삭제

5) Re-build the images - this time with names and tags assigned to them.
docker build -t node-demo:latest .

6) Run new containers based on the re-built images, ensuring that the containers
are removed automatically when stopped.
docker run -p 8000:3000 -d --name nodeapp --rm node-demo:latest
