1) Create appropriate images
docker build .

2) Launch a container for each created image, making sure,
that the app inside the container works correctly and is usable.
docker run -it {imageID}

3) Re-create both containers and assign names to both containers.
Use these names to stop and restart both containers.
docker run -it --name pythonapp {imageID}
# 입출력 끝나면 automatically stop
docker start -i -a pythonapp

4) Clean up (remove) all stopped (and running) containers,
clean up all created images.
docker rm pythonapp
docker rm {imageID}
docker image prune -a # 이미지 전체 삭제

5) Re-build the images - this time with names and tags assigned to them.
docker build -t bmi-app:1 .

6) Run new containers based on the re-built images, ensuring that the containers
are removed automatically when stopped.
docker run -it --name bmiapp --rm bmi-app:1
